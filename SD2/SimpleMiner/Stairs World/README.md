A spin-off experiment with the main game (if you were looking for that, it's under SimpleMiner/Run_Win32!) that tested out overlaying the entire world with stairs (slabs).

Has some interesting results that come from the way moving over a consecutive rising stair-slabs (easier to do while sprinting with the Shift key) blinks you upwards each time.
... Although I still think Ladder World's the best!
